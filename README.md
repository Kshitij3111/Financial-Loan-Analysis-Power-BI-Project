# 🏦 Financial Loan Analysis  
## Project Description
---
## 📘 Introduction

The Financial Loan Project is a data visualization and analysis project aimed at delivering actionable insights into a bank's lending operations. With the increasing demand for transparency and strategic planning in the financial sector, this project enables data-driven decision-making by visualizing key metrics related to loan applications, disbursements, repayments, and borrower behavior.

The report is designed to be user-friendly, highly informative, and easy to interact with through three primary dashboards: **Summary**, **Overview**, and **Details**.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Analyze loan application trends over time
- Identify the distribution of loan types and borrower profiles
- Differentiate between performing (Good) and non-performing (Bad) loans
- Explore geographical and demographic patterns in lending
- Create a unified reporting tool for decision-makers in the bank

## 🧩 Dashboard Breakdown

### 🔹 Dashboard 1: Summary

![Screenshot (18)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66ff237f-801d-4b63-996e-12488f8f054c)


This dashboard provides a high-level snapshot of the overall loan performance using Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). These KPIs track trends over time and compare Month-to-Date (MTD) values and Month-over-Month (MoM) changes. 

#### Key Metrics:

1. **Total Loan Applications**  
   - Total number of loans applied for in a given time frame
   - MTD and MoM metrics help identify spikes or drops in demand

2. **Total Funded Amount**  
   - Sum of all loan amounts disbursed
   - Helps understand disbursement trends and liquidity usage

3. **Total Amount Received**  
   - Total repayment amount received from borrowers
   - Useful for tracking incoming cash flows

4. **Average Interest Rate**  
   - Average rate across all loans
   - Helps understand overall profitability and risk profile

5. **Average Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio**  
   - Indicates borrower financial health
   - Higher DTI may point to higher risk

### 🔹 Good vs Bad Loan Analysis

A vital part of the dashboard distinguishes between **Good Loans** and **Bad Loans** based on loan status:

#### 🟩 Good Loans:
- Status: `Fully Paid` or `Current`
- Indicates financially healthy and compliant borrowers

##### Good Loan KPIs:
- % of Good Loan Applications
- Total Good Loan Applications
- Funded Amount for Good Loans
- Total Received Amount for Good Loans

#### 🔺 Bad Loans:
- Status: `Charged Off`
- Indicates default or non-recoverable loans

##### Bad Loan KPIs:
- % of Bad Loan Applications
- Total Bad Loan Applications
- Funded Amount for Bad Loans
- Total Received Amount for Bad Loans

This segmentation helps in evaluating portfolio risk and improving lending criteria.

### 🔹 Loan Status Grid View

A tabular breakdown of loan metrics categorized by **Loan Status** (e.g., Current, Fully Paid, Charged Off, Late). This view allows for:
- Quick comparison across statuses
- Performance tracking by status
- Insight into status-wise contribution to total loan amounts

Each row includes:
- Total Applications  
- Total Funded  
- Total Received  
- MTD Funded  
- MTD Received  
- Avg. Interest Rate  
- Avg. DTI
